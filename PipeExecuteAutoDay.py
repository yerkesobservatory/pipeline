''' This is a version of a script that executes the Data Reduction Pipeline
    from a folder one level above the images. The final goal is to have a script 
    connected to Yerkes' File Manager server that will automatically execute 
    whenever new images are uploaded, or on a set time interval (whichever is 
    more practical).

    This version of the pipeline is optimized for use with i/r/g-band images.
    It will still work if they are not there, but the order of images run through
    the pipeline may be incorrect.  If a different combination of filters are
    being used, the code can be edited appropriately (this version contains
    'dummy' code that is currently commented out that can be easily
    edited/uncommented to work with any set of desired filters).

HISTORY:
2022: - Updated for not reducing shutter files
      - Added code to only reduce 100 files per observation
2017/06/23: This version processes all inputs into the pipeine instead of just 3
            inputs, so StepMakeRGB can get the desired  3 best inputs for a jpg
            image -- Atreyo Pal
2015/02/23: This version can be executed without system arguments to process
            files from the current day -- Ben Mahon
2015/01/07: This version of the automatic pipeline should be used to reduce
            all images taken on a specific day.  -- Neil S.
2015/01/05: Edited code to automatically find and process all image files from
            a specified multi-level directory  -- Neil S.
2014/08/07: Added code to allow for use with only one or two FITS files -NS
2014/07/29: Original script created by Neil Stilin. Only used in local folder.

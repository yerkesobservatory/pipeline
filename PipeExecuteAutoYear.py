''' This is a version of a script that executes the Data Reduction Pipeline
    from a folder two levels above the images. The final goal is to have a script 
    connected to Yerkes' File Manager server that will automatically execute 
    whenever new images are uploaded, or on a set time interval (whichever is 
    more practical).

    This version of the pipeline is optimized for use with i/r/g-band images.
    It will still work if they are not there, but the order of images run through
    the pipeline may be incorrect.  If a different combination of filters are
    being used, the code can be edited appropriately (this version contains 'dummy'
    code that is currently commented out that can be easily edited/uncommented to
    work with any set of desired filters).

''' HISTORY '''

''' 2017/07/13: This version processes all inputs into the pipeine instead of just 3 inputs, so StepMakeRGB can get the desired  3 best inputs for a jpgimage -- Atreyo Pal
    2014/07/29: Original script created by Neil Stilin. Only used in local folder.
    2014/08/07: Added code to allow for use with only one or two FITS files -NS
    2015/01/05: Edited code to automatically find and process all image files from a specified multi-level directory  -- Neil S.
    2015/01/07: This version should be used to reduce all images taken in a given year; added a confirmation function to remove possiblity of unintentional use.  -- Neil
